This repository contained a game built using Unity for personal learning. Each RAR file will be a new version. Do note that you will need to unzip the file using WinRar or other compressors capable of extracting RAR files. Assets used are drawn by me, however, Venti (Wind Sprite) is owned by Mihoyo (Hoyoverse outside of China Region).

The following is the download page link for WinRAR [Download WinRAR](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm).
## Version notes
### V1.0
Base functionality model of the game. 
- Game load to immediately start.
- Game over screen with a button to restart.
- Spacebar input to make the bird fly.
- Score tally.

### V1.1
- Added High Score using Playerpref (Note: Playerpref is un-reset-able by default thus your gained high score will not be reset so long as you don't delete it in the registry of Windows. Adding a reset high score button is considered for the next update).
- Adjusted difficulties.
